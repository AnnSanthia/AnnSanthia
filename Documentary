Project Title: Sonic The Hedgehog

Purpose of my project: It's to entertain the viewers, representing that coding is not boring and actually fun,
but it takes a while to do. as stated in the Project title, my project is about the cartoon character Sonic The Hedgehog.
if you try to run the code, a Text Art of Sonic will appear. 

How to run my project: It's easy to run my program, just basically double click the folder or find the pause like button on the upper rigt corner and click it.
the Text Art of Sonic will appear.
